For example, the Web site for IBM has the home page address of http://www.ibm.com. <br>(The home page address actually includes a specific file name like index.html but, as in IBM's case, when a standard default name is set up, users don't have to enter the file name.) IBM's home page address leads to thousands of pages. (But a Web site can also be just a few pages.)</p></div>

            The text between the <em>&lt;title&gt;</em> tags is the title of your document. The title tag is used to uniquely
            identify each document and is also displayed in the title bar of the browser window.
            The text between the body tags is the text that will be displayed in your browser.
            The text between the b and /b tags will be displayed in a bold font.
            HTM or HTML Extension?
            When you save an HTML file, you can use either the .htm or the .html extension. The .htm extension

                Several basic attributes types have been recognized, includin required attributes, needed by a particular element type for that element type to function correctly optional attributes, used to modify the default functionality of an element type standard attributes, supported by a large number of element types and event attributes, used to cause element types to specify scripts to be run under specific circumstances.<br>

                Some attribute types function differently when used to modify different element types. For example, the attribute name is used by several element types, but has slightly different functions in each.<br>

                  When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. 
                  It defines:
                  <br>    The HTML elements as objects
                  <br>    The properties of all HTML elements

                         CSS is a style language that defines layout of HTML documents. For example, CSS covers fonts, colours, margins, lines, height, width, background images, advanced positions and many other things. Just wait and see!<br>
                         HTML can be (mis-)used to add layout to websites. But CSS offers more options and is more accurate and sophisticated. CSS is supported by all browsers today.After only a few lessons of this tutorial you will be able to make your own style sheets using CSS to give your website a new great look.

                     <p>
                         HTML is used to structure content. CSS is used for formatting structured content.

                         Okay, it sounds a bit technical and confusing. But please continue reading. It will all make sense to you soon.

                         Back in the good old days when Madonna was a virgin and a guy called Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web, the language HTML was only used to add structure to text. An author could mark his text by stating "this is a headline" or "this is a paragraph" using HTML tags such as &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt;.

                         As the Web gained popularity, designers started looking for possibilities to add layout to online documents. To meet this demand, the browser producers (at that time Netscape and Microsoft) invented new HTML tags such as for example &lt;font&gt; which differed from the original HTML tags by defining layout - and not structure.

                         This also led to a situation where original structure tags such as &lt;table&gt; were increasingly being misused to layout pages instead of adding structure to text. Many new layout tags such as &lt;blink&gt; were only supported by one type of browser. "You need browser X to view this page" became a common disclaimer on web sites.

                         CSS was invented to remedy this situation by providing web designers with sophisticated layout opportunities supported by all browsers. At the same time, separation of the presentation style of documents from the content of documents, makes site maintenance a lot easier.
